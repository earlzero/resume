Work Experience.

2012-present. Software Developer at Yandex. I have joined development team of traffic-forecasting project for advertising platform (ETL-modifications, activemq-based mechanism for state transfer  - support of multi-master, refactoring legacy code).

I have worked on some aspects of architecture of multi-master (activemq, zookeeper, RMI), maintaining installation system (based on deb-packages), maven configuration (build system is complicated due to environment requirements), system optimization, Vaadin-based gui, ETL and porting some legacy modules. I have done a research on forecasting winning bids for RTB-platform (Real-Time Bidding).
Most recents tasks include big data processing on proprietary map-reduce framework and machine learning (with scikit-lean, vowpal wabbit).
